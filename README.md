# CNN_Project

CNN_Project is a project where I use Pytorch to build a convolutional neural network to classify images - in this case, classifying dog breeds.

## Environment Setup

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

Before running this you should change the first line of the yml file to your desired environment name. Default is "deep-learning"

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

Feel free to play around with the notebook. Follow the instructions to find out what dog YOU most resemble!

The notebook is intended to be self explanatory - most of the reason I'm writing this is because it's a graduation requirement for me to write 3 readmes...
